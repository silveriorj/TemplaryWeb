# TemplaryWeb

It consists in a web application that will be used to organize the temple lodge.

In this application, we have some modules, like Event Calendar, that defines the events that will occur, the opened and closed ceremonies, the Finantial module, that can be seen for everyone, but changed only by the Board Members.

We have the Attendance list for the members presence control, the Library to save the member's presentations and the users control.
